links2 (2.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Links 2 ships its own list of Certificate Authorities Root
  Certificates since release 2.15. The according upstream changelog entry
  says:

        Use built-in SSL certificates
        This improves tor hardening (the tor exit node could not differentiate
        links users from each other based on installed certificates)
        It also makes it possible to use certificate verification on systems
        with no default certificate store

  Despite the above entry suggests that this feature is activated by
  default, it doesn't seem so: You need to activate it under "Setup →
  Network Options → SSL options → Use built-in certificates".
